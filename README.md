Netflix Data Cleaning and Analysis Using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn is a project focused on extracting meaningful insights from a Netflix dataset by performing data cleaning, exploration, and visualization. The project begins by loading the dataset using Pandas, followed by data cleaning processes such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types for consistency. Once the data is clean, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted to uncover patterns and trends. This includes examining content distribution by genre, release year, and duration, as well as analyzing audience preferences over time. Visualizations play a key role, and libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn are utilized to create insightful plots such as bar charts, heatmaps, and line graphs. These visualizations help reveal trends, such as the growth of Netflixâ€™s content library, the popularity of specific genres, or release trends across years. This project showcases the integration of data cleaning techniques and powerful visualization tools to transform raw data into actionable insights, highlighting the capabilities of Python libraries in data analysis and storytelling.
